1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,960
So I'm going to show you the ERD that I created for

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,020
the website for Code Energy Solar.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,500
So we have the entities right here.

4
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,129
The main subject of this website is to provide the users orders,

5
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:28,509
to provide the equipment, like solar panels and solar inverters.

6
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,605
So, we're starting right here. We have the

7
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:42,485
user entity that is holding

8
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:47,749
the id, user id, user name, mail,

9
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:43,645
password and after we have the entity order

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:47,885
that is holding every

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,430
one right here and we also

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:56,591
have the budget entity, items, structure, solar panel and solar inverter.

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,368
So the connection, the relationship between these entities is the following. So, for one

14
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:09,588
user we can have many orders or many budgets.

15
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:15,148
We can have just one order for each one budget.

16
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:18,848
We can have many items.

17
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,646
For one budget.

18
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:29,346
And we can also add like one solar inverter,

19
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:34,146
one solar panel and one kind of structure for the list of items.

20
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:39,854
After we added all the items we need,

21
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:45,114
we can create the budget and we can create many budgets

22
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,594
for one user. And then,

23
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,754
after we get what we want,

24
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:52,574
we can go
